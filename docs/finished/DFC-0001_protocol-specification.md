## Cancellation

This charter was the leftover first task of the docs-first continuity protocol
extraction. This repository is RE:WIND. The identity `DFC-0001` remains taken.
Replacement work is `REW-0001`, establish canonical project state.

The charter below is the Draft text as it stood when cancelled. It was never
moved to `Ready` and no specification was written.

## Read First

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/TASK_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/SYSTEMDOC.md`
- `docs/JOURNAL.md`
- `docs/FILESTRUCTURE.md`
- `baseline/README.md` and `extraction/ledger.md`

## Task Summary

Write `SPEC.md`: the normative requirements of the protocol, numbered so that
conformance results, issues and profiles can cite them precisely.

The material already exists. `baseline/acme-2026-08-19/` holds the hardened
model verbatim and `extraction/ledger.md` classifies twenty-eight rule groups as
CORE, PROFILE or PROJECT with an intended destination for each. This task turns
the CORE rows into requirements without softening them, and leaves the PROFILE
rows for the profile documents.

## Task Charter

The charter is editable while status is `Draft` and immutable once status is
`Ready`.

### Goal

Produce the normative specification of the protocol core, traceable rule by rule
to the baseline it came from.

### Primary Deliverable

`SPEC.md`, containing numbered requirements grouped by entry and ownership,
active work, continuity, containment, addressing, multiple actors and
resumability, together with the conformance levels that map onto them.

### In Scope

- Write one requirement per CORE row in `extraction/ledger.md`, keeping the
  force of the baseline rule and parameterizing only project identity.
- Group requirements and assign stable identifiers. An identifier, once written,
  is cited by conformance output and may not be renumbered.
- Define the conformance levels and state which requirements each level covers,
  and by what means each is checked: validator, git history, or a named review
  ritual.
- State, for every requirement, whether it is machine-checkable or ritual-checked.
  A requirement that is neither does not belong in the specification.
- Mark the four requirements whose baseline rules are hours old rather than
  months, so that a reader can weigh them accordingly.
- Update `extraction/ledger.md` so every CORE row names the requirement it
  became.
- Update `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` and `docs/FILESTRUCTURE.md`.

### Out of Scope

- Templates, profiles, the validator, examples, case studies, the evidence
  report. Each is its own task.
- Editing anything under `baseline/`.
- Choosing the project name or the license.
- Making the repository public.
- Simplifying or merging baseline rules. If a rule seems redundant, record the
  observation in `docs/backlog/` rather than dropping it; the model was hardened
  by failures that the text does not always show.

### Definition of Done

- Every CORE row in the ledger names the requirement it became, and every
  requirement names the ledger row it came from.
- Each requirement states its checking means.
- The conformance levels cover every requirement exactly once.
- The specification is readable in one sitting.
- `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` no longer says the specification does not exist.
- `docs/JOURNAL.md` has a signed entry and this task is archived.

### Minimum Verification Gates

- [ ] Every CORE ledger row maps to exactly one requirement, checked by reading
      the ledger end to end
- [ ] Every requirement maps back to a ledger row
- [ ] Manual link and fence review, since this repository has no tooling yet
- [ ] `git diff --check` clean

## Checklist

- [ ] Claim DFC-0001 on `main` before freezing this charter
- [ ] Draft the requirement groups and identifiers
- [ ] Write one requirement per CORE ledger row
- [ ] Assign checking means to each requirement
- [ ] Define the conformance levels
- [ ] Mark the recently added requirements
- [ ] Backfill the ledger with requirement identifiers
- [ ] Update status and file structure
- [ ] Add a signed journal entry and archive this task

## Decisions and Notes

- Transcription, not redesign. A rewrite from memory keeps the parts that read
  well and drops the failure knowledge that is the actual value.
- Requirement identifiers are permanent. They will appear in conformance output,
  issue titles and profile documents, and those citations cannot be repaired
  afterwards.
- If a rule cannot be classified confidently as CORE, it is PROFILE. The core
  stays small; a profile rule can be promoted later, but a core rule that turns
  out to be local is expensive to remove.

## Charter Amendment Log

Only non-semantic corrections are allowed after `Ready`.

-none

## Verification

- [ ] Ledger and specification cross-check, both directions
- [ ] Manual link and fence review
- [ ] `git diff --check`
- [ ] Document skipped checks and reasons

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- [ ] `docs/FILESTRUCTURE.md`
- [ ] `docs/JOURNAL.md`
- [ ] `extraction/ledger.md`

## Handoff and Follow-ups

- Current state: Cancelled. This repository is RE:WIND, not a protocol
  specification project. `extraction/ledger.md` was removed from the working
  tree as part of the reboot. The frozen baseline remains under
  `docs/baseline/` as provenance for the working model.
- Next recommended step: none. See REW-0001.
- Blockers: none.
- Child tasks: none.
- Resume condition: not applicable.
- Open questions: none.

## Finalize When Complete

- Archive this file under `docs/finished/`.
- Restore this template or populate the next approved task.
- Add a signed `docs/JOURNAL.md` entry.
- If Goal or Definition of Done changed, supersede this task instead of
  rewriting it.
