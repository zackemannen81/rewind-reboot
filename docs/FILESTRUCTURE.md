## Conventions

Every collection under `docs/` declares one discoverability mode in its
`README.md`: `index`, meaning every member is listed there, or a naming
convention that makes every member addressable without a list. `docs/finished/`
uses the convention `DFC-NNNN_task-slug.md`; the others are indexed.

Collections whose members carry lifecycle state also declare
`Member state: required`, and each member declares a `Status:` line under its
title. State lives in content and in the index, never in a filename.

A record cited by `docs/JOURNAL.md`, `docs/finished/` or an accepted decision
keeps its path. Renaming it cannot be repaired, because the citations live in
records that may not be edited.

## Not yet present

The specification, templates, profiles, conformance validator, case studies and
evidence report do not exist. When they arrive they will sit beside `docs/` as
`SPEC.md`, `templates/`, `profiles/`, `conformance/`, `examples/` and
`case-studies/`, and this map must be updated in the same change.
